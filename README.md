# phone_search
User can search for their standalone ad page using phone number listed with their ad in a database
phone_search.php takes the phone number from user saved to session variable, and searches for number in dtabase. If it exists, it returns record data needed to build a url for the ad. The url already exists in this project. Page then redirects to that url. 
Database connection and url logic is already in this project. This phone search was added as a feature to enhance user accessibility.
